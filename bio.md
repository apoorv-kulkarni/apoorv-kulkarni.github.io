## Super Concise Intro

## Long Intro

I currently work as a SRE at Roblox

A jack of all trades kind of software engineer but I am trying to steer myself towards specializing in scalability
I have led teams, I have been part of teams, I have built things alone.
I have built products (Front end, back end, database design), I have optimized core process in some cases to 500% of improvements, I have managed infrastructures that hosts our products, automated builds and tooling for most of these products as well. Most of my products range from a desktop app to Enterprise SaaS products 

My contributions have led to build products that generate annual revenue of $50,000+ in emerging markets in Asia to $1B+  in enterprise cloud.

That being said, I am no genius, I learned everything by googling for things and reading manuals. I will probably do the same at my future jobs, continuously learn different things and experiment with new tech, apply them.
