# Cover letter type of introductions

## Super Concise Intro
Building enterprise cloud apps used to securely managing APIs, build tooling & automation for various infrastructure(s) and make things go really fast. 

I am trying to be an industry expert but I am really a jack of all trades.

## Long Intro
A jack of all trades kind of software engineer.
I have led teams, I have been part of teams, I have built things alone.
I have built products (Front end, back end, database design), I have optimized core process in some cases to 500% of improvements, I have managed infrastructures that hosts our products, automated builds and tooling for most of these products as well. Most of my products range from a desktop app to Enterprise SaaS products 

My contributions have led to build products that generate annual revenue of $50,000+ in emerging markets in Asia to $100+ million in enterprise cloud.

That being said, I am no genius or a Google Level guy, I learned everything by googling for things and reading manuals. I will probably do the same at my future jobs, continuously learn different things and experiment with new tech, apply them. 

Move on to the next goals.

My current goal is to help build a product that will scale up vertically to cater to millions of api calls. Gain expertise in architecture and the new container based approaches and become a principal software architect in the near future.
